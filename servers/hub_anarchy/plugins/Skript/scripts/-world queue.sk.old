# This skript assumes that the world that players spawn into by default is the world which you want players to connect to from the queue

options:
	# The world which you want to have the players connect to from queue
	mainworld: world, world_nether, world_the_end

	queueworld: queue
	# The max amount of players the main world can hold before the queue activates
	maxamount: 25

# It is crucial that you set the variable {queuespawn} with /setqueue (Below) for the queue can function!
